# W-AP

W-AP (**W**eather-M**ap**) is website that shows you the weather and a map based on address, city name (international), or zipcode (U.S. only).

## Design Process and Mockup

To design the website, MS Paint, SAI, and Canva were used.

## Difficulties

### Weather API

With the 5 day forecast OpenWeatherAPI, the API gave the results in 3 hour intervals, represented by an array of 40 objects, each containing their own high, low, and average temperature.

To parse through the data, we went through each object and kept track of each `temp_min` and `temp_max`.
```js
for (let d = 0; d < x.list.length - 8; d += 8) {
  day = Object.assign({}, x.list[d]);
  tempTotal = 0;

  // tslint:disable-next-line: prefer-for-of
  for (let h = d; h < 5 + d; h++) {
    const element = x.list[h];

    tempTotal += Object.assign({}, element.main).temp;

    if (day.main.temp_min > element.main.temp_min) {
      day.main.temp_min = element.main.temp_min;
    }
    if (day.main.temp_max < element.main.temp_max) {
      day.main.temp_max = element.main.temp_max;
    }

  }
```
### API Calling Issues

A user could press the search bar in quick succession and call the API multiple times while the page was still rendering, causing duplicate information to display.

We added a directive with RxJS that listened for click events and used `throttleTime` to emit only the first click within a given moment in time.

### API Leaks ðŸ˜³

It took two hours to notice but the API key was deactivated and removed. Whoopsieeee.
